# How this Project Began

This project began when someone in the BetterDiscord server posted this.
![Inspiration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73869003/150845131-88987663-e5cc-4a01-82ca-eabd9186cce0.png)

I was very interested in this, so I decided to start developing something similar. Thank you Disease for posting this.

# How this theme works

This theme was made using pure css and a couple BetterDiscord settings. 

# What you will need for this theme to work

You will need to have [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) installed, [Powertoys by Microsoft](https://aka.ms/installpowertoys) installed, and a [Discord Client](https://discord.com/download) (Canary, PTB, and Stable Releases should all work).

In the BetterDiscord settings, enable Transparency and enable Remove Minimum Size.

In the Powertoys settings, enable Always On Top and set a keybind.

Then, install Float [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cedrickzedd/BD/main/Themes/Float/Float.theme.css)

Right click the page and click "save as", then move the float.theme.css file to the BetterDiscord theme directory. Enable theme and you are set to go
# Help! THemE No WOrk, It BRoCkeN

**DO NOT PING ME OR ASK FOR SUPPORT ON MY THEME IN THE BETTERDISCORD SERVER AS THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL THEME, AND YOU WILL NOT FIND SUPPORT THERE**
