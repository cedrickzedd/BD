# How this Project Began

This project began when someone in the BetterDiscord server posted this.
![Inspiration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73869003/150845131-88987663-e5cc-4a01-82ca-eabd9186cce0.png)

I was very interested in this, so I decided to start developing something similar. Thank you Disease for posting this.

# How this theme works

This theme was made using pure css and a couple BetterDiscord settings. 

# What you will need for this theme to work

You will need to have BetterDiscord installed, Powertoys by Microsoft installed, and a Discord Client (Canary, PTB, and Stable Releases should all work).

In the BetterDiscord settings, enable Transparency and enable Remove Minimum Size.

In the Powertoys settings, enable Always On Top and set a keybind.
